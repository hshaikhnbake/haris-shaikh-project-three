Pseudocode

// Create an Event Listener so that when a card is clicked it shows a card -- (i.e. displayCard Function on click)

// Have displayCard function outline whether a card is hidden, shown, and disabled(after user chooses correct choice)

// Have cards shuffle on load/restart

// Run if/else statement to determine if cards match or don't match

// Create a counter for the amount of attempts a user takes
